GhostRawTextExtension
=====================

Chrome Extension - Adds RAW TEXT button to your Ghost posts editor. This enable the simple mode where the browser spell checking is working.

I couldn't find a spell checker support in Ghost bloging platform (https://ghost.org). I couldn't find integration points to extended for this feature so I created chrome extension which does this job.
