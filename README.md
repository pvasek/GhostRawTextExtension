GhostRawTextExtension
=====================

Chrome Extension - Adds RAW TEXT button to your ghost editor. This enable to switch editor to the simple mode where the browser spell checking is working.

I couldn't find a spell checker support in Ghost bloging platform (https://ghost.org). I couldn't find integration points to extended for this feature so I created chrome extension which does this job.

## Install
You can install the chrome extension from Chrome Web Store:
